                                            The musings of the wise quintessence of an intergalactic Russel Crowe when juxtaposed with the career of film renaissance artist Zack Snyder shows you exactly how similar the creator of this story is to its protagonist. As an amateur film reviewer, I am going to make one crucial declaration- Zack Snyder is the most misunderstood film director in Hollywood. I’m also going to push that declaration further by saying that Mr Zachary Edward Snyder is a creative genius. When one makes such a declaration, it often comes with a caveat- declaring someone as a genius or a misunderstood Renaissance artist does not imply that all their work is perfect. To further this argument of Zack Snyder being a creative genius I chose to explore his perhaps most misunderstood work- Man of Steel. This wasn’t his first foray into the superhero realm by any means; he had earlier directed Watchmen in 2008, an indie, gritty, edgy commentary on society with a cult-like following.
                                            
                                            When looking at Man of Steel, one must look at the times in which it was released. The year was 2013- a year after Disney came out with blockbuster superhit fan favourite Avengers. The commercial success of The Avengers was what many studios hoped to emulate, hence media conglomerate Warner Brothers decided to capitalize on their possession over the intellectual rights of one DC Comics.

                                            WB had just released the last of its Dark Knight series- The Dark Knight Rises in 2012- to massive commercial success. The gritty realism of the movie tied with Nolan’s classic flare for intellectual exploration of complex ideas created another Christopher Nolan masterpiece. However, this world created by Christopher Nolan was far too realistic, much akin to our real world, to set up a universe where gods and aliens roam the earth. WB was compelled to create their own universe of heroes, and hence decided to create an entirely new universe, separate from that of Nolan’s series, with our Superman as the titular lead. 
                                            
                                            Soon, WB announced an all star band to headline the show- Dark Knight series writer David Goyer writing the script alongside Dark Knight director Christopher Nolan working in cohesion with Dark Knight composer Hans Zimmer. With the Dark Knight talent involved, it was clear that WB wanted to inject the very ethos of Dark Knight into the story of Kansas reporter Clark Kent. They brought in Watchmen and 300 director Zack Snyder- a man adept at translating a comic book page to the big screen- to execute the script. It almost seems as if the creative team behind the story was a match made in heaven- the most elite group ever assembled to make a comic book movie. So one crucial question remains- Why was this movie so panned by viewers despite its All Star Team? Let’s explore why viewers were wrong to pan this masterpiece, and why this story should be considered a revolutionary work of art.
                                            
                                            The movie starts on Krypton- a new Krypton, one we’ve never seen before. The visuals and the costumes on the Krypton in this universe are almost Shakespearean, yet also being futuristic in its portrayal of how Kryptonian society works. It is a society divided into 2 factions- intellectuals and the generals. This is where we’re first introduced to Zod, our main antagonist. Here, he’s portrayed by Michael Shannon, as a ruthless, impulsive, angry utilitarian who is a tragic character- one who is watching his people and his planet die before his eyes, yet remaining helpless to stop it. Shannon delivers his lines with a laser focused purpose, already letting the audience in on the importance of Zod to this story and exposing them to Shannon’s powerful performance.
                                            
                                            This is what makes Shannon’s character complex, and the backbone of this movie. Zack Snyder knows that a story is only as good as its villain, and making the audience sympathetic to this character adds a deeper level of meaning and understanding to this story. Zod’s ultra-utilitarian military rationalism is at odds with the Man of Steel’s classic pragmatic ultra righteous, ultra moral optimism. It is this clash of philosophies that Snyder explores by using Henry Cavill and Michael Shannon as mouthpieces for these philosophies- a move made by Snyder earlier in Watchmen where Rorschach’s nihilistic ultra rationalism was contrasted with Nite Owl’s optimistic moralism.
                                            
                                            Similar to Watchmen, Snyder does a social experiment with our main character, a character study if you will- one which asks the question: How would society if there was a tangible, physical god living among us? This narrative is woven with realism, showing us that if the Man of Steel lived in our world, there would be a lot of people that would look to him for hope, but there would also be a lot that would have a rational cause to fear his power. This duality is further explored by Snyder in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. 
                                            
                                            Here, Jonathan Kent becomes the voice of reason. In most iterations of the Superman story, Jonathan Kent is an optimist- one who is eager to let Clark shed his skin and save those who are too helpless to save themselves. In this iteration, Jonathan Kent becomes the voice of reason- he believes that Clark shouldn’t reveal his powers under any circumstances as the people of this planet are not ready for Clark yet, they would fear him for obvious reasons. 
                                            
                                            In my opinion, this version of Jonathan Kent clicks with me the most as Snyder perfectly understands the emotional machinations of an adoptive parent, being one himself. Jonathan Kent’s sacrifice in the movie is one that echoes the themes of sacrifice and hope, one where sacrifices need to be made to save those who need it the most. The themes of sacrifices and hope are core to the character of Superman, and Jonathan Kent serving as a mouthpiece for the realistic take on those themes serves as a stepping stone for Clark’s transition into the Man of Steel, thereby making the moment more cathartic. 
                                             </p>
                                        <p>After Jonathan’s demise, we see Clark mature into a brooding man who is lost in the world and unsure of his purpose. This take on Superman shows us that the Man of Steel is not infallible- he has his own emotions and the ability to make mistakes. We see that this Superman is more human than he is an alien, and Henry Cavill serves as the perfect vessel to portray the character. His brooding nature serves as yet another stepping stone for Clark to transition from a god in hiding, to the optimistic beacon of hope that we know him to be. This adds another layer of complexity to this story where his god-status is contrasted with an aftertaste of Snyder’s classic humanism.

                                            Halfway through the movie is when our Clark decides to be Superman, and this is perhaps my favourite sequence through the entire movie. With the words of Jor El in the voiceover, we see Henry Cavill for the first time in the Red and Blue contrasted with a white background to make the colors of the suit pop off screen. Hans Zimmer’s droning instrumentals slowly and steadily makes its rise until a cathartic emotional crescendo is experienced by the audience when Clark first takes off. We see Superman’s true power with the particles of dust that disobey gravity right before his first flight- these are creative visuals meant to contrast the music. He is finally the beacon of hope that the world so desperately needs. Hans Zimmer’s music is what does the heavy lifting for this scene for me. And i’ll also admit myself- that this is a classic phenomenon of the director indulging in style over substance. However, when the style is this damn good, is it really a bad thing to have more style than substance? I’ll let you be the judge.
                                            
                                            Where people disagree with the movie is when Zod first appears and Clark chooses to surrender himself to Zod. The biggest critique people have of Snyder is that he has misunderstood the character, Superman would be the first to save people rather than surrender. However, Snyder’s Superman doesn’t necessarily detract from that notion. Clark chooses to surrender himself so that no harm would come to the people of Earth; here, Superman is making the hard choice between Krypton and humanity. After learning Zod’s plan, Superman makes the decision to let Krypton die and humanity live- because that’s the most Superman a Superman can be. When Superman decides to kill Zod, he very visibly regrets the decision but has to inevitably live with it because it was this decision that Superman needed to make in the heat of battle for the greater good.
                                            
                                            In my opinion, this is the best iteration of Superman and is the best on-screen version to exist. Snyder has not misunderstood the character, he has merely taken the ideals that are core to the character and has adapted them for our times. When going into this movie, erase from your mind the pre-conceived notion of what a superhero movie is; render it a blank state. Now open your mind to what a Superhero movie could be. This is not a bombastic, quippy superhero adventure as one might expect, but a meditative piece on optimism, morality, hope and sacrifice- a character study on what if Superman was real. Over a period of time, I have quite begrudgingly grown to love Snyder’s work. The question now remains- Are you willing to join him in the sun?
